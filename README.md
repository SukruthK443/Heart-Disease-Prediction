# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In a heart disease prediction project using Python, we utilized machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The process involved data collection and loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations, and data preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize features. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the models, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection were performed to optimize the models. The project demonstrated how Python and machine learning can be applied to predict heart disease, providing valuable insights for the healthcare industry1
